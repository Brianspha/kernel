## Smart Contracts

The point of this course is very specifically NOT to overwhelm you with links we know you're more than capable of finding and using on your own. The truth is that there are a great many tools out there, each of which makes different trade-offs and will be better or worse depending on your needs and context. This is what mentors are for: we recommend you spend more time picking their brains than scrolling through endless Awesome lists of half-maintained, experimental tools. That said, here are some really great educational resources:

## Development

Again, there are an almost endless amount of tools which are great depending on your needs and context. You can ask our mentors which frameworks and libraries are best to use for your specific project and purpose. Below we list some useful collections which will help you get where you really need to be as quickly as possible, while giving you a good sense of the overall landscape of possible tools available to you.

## Community Recommendations

The single most important part of this page. These are the tools that the KERNEL Genesis Block recommend based on their own, personal use.
