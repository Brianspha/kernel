# Smart Contracts

The point of this course is very specifically NOT to overwhelm you with links we know you're more than capable of finding and using on your own. The truth is that there are a great many tools out there, each of which makes different trade-offs and will be better or worse depending on your needs and context. This is what mentors are for: we recommend you spend more time picking their brains than scrolling through endless Awesome lists of half-maintained, experimental tools. That said, here are some really great educational resources:

## Beginner - getting started

It can be difficult to know exactly where to get started in such a new field, with so many resources scattered around the web. We'll do our best to try and suggest a coherent path through all the different docs and tools that will move you from zero to hero over the course of the next few weeks.
