# Smart Contracts

The point of this course is very specifically NOT to overwhelm you with links we know you're more than capable of finding and using on your own. The truth is that there are a great many tools out there, each of which makes different trade-offs and will be better or worse depending on your needs and context. This is what mentors are for: we recommend you spend more time picking their brains than scrolling through endless Awesome lists of half-maintained, experimental tools. That said, here are some really great educational resources:
